Automatic Sentiment Analysis Tool for Urdu Text on Social Media Platforms
Project Title:

Development of an Automatic Sentiment Analysis Tool for Urdu Text on Social Media Platforms
Overview:

This project is focused on developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to perform sentiment analysis on Urdu text extracted from various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. The aim is to classify the posts as positive, negative, or neutral, helping brands, influencers, and businesses understand sentiment trends from Urdu-speaking users.
Scenario:

As a data scientist, I was tasked with creating a sentiment analysis tool designed specifically for the Urdu language, addressing the complexities of grammar, morphology, and noisy social media data. This project contributes to addressing the lack of language resources and NLP tools for Urdu.
Key Features:

    Text Preprocessing:
        Stopword Removal: Custom stopword list development.
        Punctuation, Emoji, and Hashtag Removal: Clean and filter irrelevant tokens.
        Diacritics Removal: Handling Urdu text diacritics (Zabar, Zer, Pesh).

    Stemming & Lemmatization:
        Implementation of stemming and lemmatization tailored for Urdu, reducing words to their base forms.

    Feature Extraction:
        Tokenization: Properly segmenting Urdu text into words.
        TF-IDF Analysis: Extracting relevant terms for sentiment classification.
        Word2Vec: Capturing context-based word relationships.

    N-grams Analysis:
        Creating unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams to uncover common patterns in Urdu social media posts.

    Sentiment Classification Model:
        Trained machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and SVM to classify sentiments.
        Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are provided for model performance.

Challenges Addressed:

    Urdu Text Complexity: The grammatical structure and morphological changes in Urdu pose challenges to NLP.
    Noisy Social Media Data: Special handling of emojis, spelling variations, URLs, and incomplete sentences.
    Limited Language Resources: Custom solutions for Urdu stemming, tokenization, and sentiment lexicons.

Tools & Libraries:

    Python for development
    NLTK, spaCy, Urduhack for text processing
    Scikit-learn for machine learning models
    Gensim for Word2Vec implementation
    pandas, matplotlib for data analysis and visualization

Dataset:

    A publicly available Urdu social media dataset from platforms such as Twitter or YouTube comments was used. This dataset contains raw posts and their sentiment labels.

Final Deliverables:

    Text Preprocessing results
    Tokenization and Feature Extraction results (TF-IDF, Word2Vec)
    Sentiment Classification Model summary
    N-gram Analysis showing common unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
    Evaluation Metrics with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Reflection:

This project sheds light on the challenges of performing sentiment analysis on Urdu text. Future improvements could involve incorporating deep learning models like BERT fine-tuned for Urdu or leveraging additional Urdu language datasets for better performance.
